# Duplicate and Unique Elements Processing in Arrays

This repository contains several functions designed to process arrays by finding duplicate and unique elements. The functions perform operations such as finding duplicates, removing duplicates, and categorizing elements into duplicates and non-duplicates. The code also provides functionality for returning arrays with duplicates removed and identifying unique elements.

## Functions

### 1. `findDuplicates(arr)`
This function finds the duplicate elements in an array and returns them.

#### Parameters:
- `arr` (Array): The input array that you want to check for duplicates.

#### Returns:
- `duplicates` (Array): An array containing the duplicate elements in the input array.

#### Example:
```javascript
let originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 1, 3, 7];
let duplicateArray = findDuplicates(originalArray);
console.log("Duplicate Elements:", duplicateArray);
